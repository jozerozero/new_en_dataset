43	Clay is a retired law enforcement officer in Georgia and his also tested positive for Coronavirus.
253	even comedians are talking about it.
61	I wanted to be sure on this.
179	what do you recommend people do to enhance and bolster up their own immune system?
202	she was modeled after Doctor Schuchat.
180	this is simply not true.
118	symptoms can include a cough sore throat headache and a fever that lasts a few days.
37	we still don't have enough evidence that these drugs are effective in humans.
302	course there's no way to know where Tom Hanks actually contracted the infection.
32	as the coronavirus spiraled into a Public Health crisis in China, a fringe Theory started to take hold on the internet.
212	how healthy you are.
116	we do see cases of flu decrease as the weather gets warmer.
151	it's a pattern that has been repeated in history.
204	the current fatality rate globally according to the WHO is around 3 to 4%.
87	first let's talk about how our government officials are describing a drug called chloroquine.
177	well, that is obviously very hopeful because you're right there where there's a lot of anxiety.
232	in the spirit of optimism do you see the light at the end of the tunnel as has been described you have a timetable that you think this is going to take.
198	the President also tweeted over the weekend that related the drug.
71	what is it been like for you you were in quarantine for for quite some time after you left Wuhan because of the potential exposure to the virus.
211	for healthy people it's not enough of a decrease it'll hardly make a dent.
120	that's why doctors are conducting studies in the United States, China and all over the world to better understand what happens when you give these drugs to a covid patient.
245	right now if somebody is concerned because they have symptoms.
182	the person delivering your takeout is not only concerned for their health and safety.
215	he consistently tested positive while in the hospital, even though he was already feeling better.
139	I can't stress enough how vital it is that you don't use or consume anything unless specifically recommended by your doctor.
205	I love that.
40	he's now being isolated at a local hospital.
229	hoping to prove its effectiveness against covid-19
35	in Nigeria Health officials issued a warning about chloroquine.
114	and if you've tested negative at least two consecutive test taking a day apart then you're not at risk of infecting others.
233	most of the time for healthy people the symptoms go away on their own.
23	Christine spoke with billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman who recently made headlines with his radical proposal to save the US economy.
225	he consistently tested positive while in the hospital even though he was already feeling better.
156	of emergency room patients for other things as they used to or is it predominantly coronavirus or not much.
187	cases can become even more severe than clays.
56	and I want to ask you some specific questions about that.
107	the FDA says they're not aware of any evidence saying that Ibuprofen makes coronavirus symptoms worse.
86	have you ever seen a response of this magnitude the National Guard now just deployed?
230	and can progress to organ failure sepsis sometimes even death.
173	but you know there's been a lot of stories about people still not taking this very seriously.
160	what are the things that has happened over the last few days here in the United States as we've seen a crippling of the economy.
74	school closures can be a nightmare situation for some parents especially if you're also working at the same time.
228	I know we've already talked about the movie Contagion.
101	his wife is currently in critical care.
192	Crogan said testing out drugs that are already FDA-approved could drastically speed up the process of finding a treatment that is safe and effective for humans.
266	Keon is korean-american and based in Los Angeles.
291	maybe they came in contact with somebody with the Coronavirus.
48	people have taken this idea to the extreme using hair dryers hot bats and UV lamps to try and disinfect themselves.
159	Nadia says her kids know that school is out because of the Coronavirus.
298	you're likely to soon hear other drug names mentioned as well.
210	it doesn't matter at all.
149	I asked my colleague Keon what advice did she have four people out there.
22	but it has not been approved as a treatment for the Coronavirus.
125	their ordeal was not over though.
277	5 days later President Trump reverse the course.
238	getting a letter from China or any country that has coronavirus cases is not going to make you sick
161	told us many of our customers cancelled their Chinese New Year bookings last minute.
9	now there's no definitive study on this but dr. Fauci has been dealing with viruses his entire professional life.
209	that was Bill Ackman the founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management.
282	so gratitude goes a long way.
51	she described what happened on Instagram.
97	last November Melanie and John Herring set off on what was supposed to be a 6-month retirement trip through Asia.
184	CNN David Culver was in China as the coronavirus outbreak began late last year.
39	what would be your advice to help people should think about this now given your experience?
41	now it didn't say whether those patients had any underlying risks.
0	this is not her first rodeo.
123	a lot of people will go through something similar to John's experience.
237	Deepaka, how are you coping?
216	there is no credible information to back this up and the posts mostly come from unverified social media accounts.
190	he recently announced that the state had procured thousands of doses of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
136	but Public Health experts say there's no way to know this for sure.
259	last week actor Timeup posted a video.
141	as a result there's a lot of information and misinformation out there.
203	even on social media we're seeing the same thing.
109	the CDC guidelines say that if you're not showing symptoms like a cough or fever.
300	she is our resident explainer in Chief of all things, money.
137	as things stand right now here in the United States and I think in many places around the world.
18	Nadia is like many of you juggling multiple jobs right now.
99	fortunately for Nadia a former teacher at Nora School reached out to families in the neighborhood offering childcare help.
165	just as John was feeling better Japanese authorities transferred him to a local hospital.
147	what kind of treatment do you have access to will undoubtedly shape your experience.
218	and I also really appreciate this idea that to slow down your thoughts.
227	where you contracted the virus?
102	describing the decision obviously of living in this this apartment in the garage away from your family.
255	and how best to talk to your kids about the outbreak?
53	so during our CNN Town Hall I asked dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of allergy and infectious diseases.
20	and ask them how the coronavirus has affected their family life.
131	performing at a comedy show called Asian strike back earlier this month.
251	what schools in communities are doing what they can to lift some of the child care in financial load.
29	wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds cover your mouth and nose when you cough and seek treatment if you're not feeling well.
167	As you heard him say this isn't the first time that an infectious disease outbreak has been linked to certain immigrant groups.
162	dr. Anne Schuchat is the principal deputy director of the CDC.
260	but we all have the capability to enhance our own immune system.
126	thankfully that was the worst of it.
299	and there are several theories why.
157	so Kate asked her daughter's pediatrician and other experts for advice.
12	you have two daughters, I have three daughters, your daughters are five and two.
214	here's Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of teachers.
93	it is unlikely that it will live after being moved, travel then exposed to different temperatures.
244	on Wednesday Hollywood actor Tom Hanks confirmed he had the virus and he's in Australia where summer just ended.
243	2 challenging question but is there something you would point to that you would say was the most important factor and that sort of recovery
45	I mean I made it very real.
171	earlier this year with only a handful of Novel coronavirus cases in America.
267	he's also the director of the medical ethics division at NYU Langone Medical Center.
63	I want to reiterate that we don't know how effective any of these treatments will be.
55	for more on this I turn to a friend and an expert, CNN medical analyst Arthur Kaplan.
150	this is a really important question.
115	as things stand out, doctor Schuchat, how easy would it be for that person to get tested.
191	the news media is constantly turning out updates and information.
186	San Francisco State University found that news about coronavirus discrimination increase by 50% across the country from February 9th through March 7th.
58	scientist in both China and the West have widely dismissed this theory, although that hasn't stopped them from spreading.
148	you started off by talking about the fact that you were hopeful about what you're now seeing in China.
172	and the entire ship was put in the quarantine.
154	really know the answer to that question.
100	what about over there how did businesses adapt to The New Normal?
185	but also in institutional policies like the Immigration Act of 1924.
166	John symptoms were not nearly as severe as clay Bentleys.
65	it becomes a little a little blurry there right it's not just about the economy in that situation.
10	which severely limited immigration from Asia and parts of Europe.
104	the best way to protect yourself is to practice good hygiene.
288	now some doctors are having to make those hard choices in real life.
178	make sure they could purchase groceries for them if they can't get out of the house.
303	finally if you have any questions please record them as a voice memo and email them to ask Sanjay at CNN dot com.
242	these are myths and they really work.
8	the other drug name being floated around is an antiviral called Remdesivir.
174	and there's also no way to know for sure what role heat or humidity have to play here.
1	CNN spoke to Arne Duncan the former education secretary under President Obama.
84	using the plasma of people who have recovered.
69	that's just one month.
108	and she's not alone.
94	it might even include them in the podcast.
263	that it's safe to go back to a more normal life where you can, you know, spend time with your kids again.
142	saying three people overdosed on the drug after hearing it described as a possible treatment.
11	leaving aside International countries for a while would you recommend people not travel?
220	and maybe the right question is how should I act around my kids with regard to this in.
270	people who have underlying health conditions are those who are older do need to take extra precautions.
289	it's not just individual attacks.
17	that the virus was man made in a lab.
121	we are seeing cases of the coronavirus currently spreading in hot countries.
140	I've heard this question a lot and there's some merit to this concern.
128	then one day after 2 weeks he finally had a test come back negative.
112	what is the guidance the CDC is giving?
25	and there are multiple stages of those trials.
88	I'm in February roses business was down some 70 to 80%.
133	that's why in some states they are beginning to.
269	tip as much as you can.
226	my specialty is medicine not the economy.
284	the economy is also top of mind for New York's Governor Andrew Cuomo.
66	on February 6th one of the thousands of people who'd been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship with them tested positive for the virus.
113	we also don't know if it would cause problems during the pregnancy or affect the baby.
68	chloroquine is used to treat malaria and has been around for decades.
271	Gilead Sciences which manufactures Remdesivir is pulling back an emergency request for the drug due to overwhelming demand.
193	but if the narrative is look if you're young and healthy you'll be okay but the elderly people, ah, seventies and eighties in particular have a lot to worry about.
247	hydroxychloroquine in combination with an antibiotic commonly known as a z-pack could become game changers.
158	we're in this together so let's help each other out.
188	people who will inquire onto neighbor's well-being especially elderly in.
207	he narrowly escaped Wuhan just before the city was put in the lockdown on January 23rd.
304	the issue that I think a lot of people are starting to ask about is is this an either or conversation is there either economic damage.
153	we've actually done a good job of staying in touch and it's been it's been really nice.
201	and this is what he said.
3	NBC News spoke to the wife who said they learned of the drugs connection to a coronavirus during a news conference on TV.
81	some point to the physics of the virus itself other point to the fact that kids major transmitters of the flu aren't in school anymore.
92	but we do know that pregnant women are more vulnerable to other respiratory illnesses like the flu.
181	I spoke to her in the hospital and asked if she was surprised it had now become the epicenter of New York State's coronavirus outbreak.
208	he says he's been seeing a lot of great leadership and creativity on the local and state level.
59	our team visited Nadia and her family at home last week to see how they've been doing.
57	your daily work changed, I mean, are you still seeing the same number?
236	of course everyone's situation is different.
91	there is currently no cure and while we're search is underway it could be more than a year before a vaccine becomes available.
111	it's already been tested on adults diagnosed with the coronavirus in the United States and China.
292	director of the US Centers for Disease Control and prevention Doctor Robert Redfield discuss Remdesivir in Congressional testimony earlier this month.
219	it was a recent small study of 9 women who were infected with the virus and none of their babies were affected by.
290	but now this is becoming a permanent home or at least temporary permanent home.
152	but I can reduce your ability to fight off an infection.
135	there are many home remedies doing the rounds, drinking water or taking garlic or vitamin C.
224	but it really does strike me even when I've been at the hospital recently Just in that.
49	some of the rumors out there are ridiculous.
6	it seems, Rachel, sometimes the sentiment is, I'm not taking it seriously.
60	or health damage.
33	I spoke with Rachel patzer director of the center of Health Services Research and Emory and her husband Doctor Justin Schrager who's a physician in Emery's emergency department.
28	President Donald Trump is previously suggested that heat kills the virus and that it would be over by Spring.
280	from what we know so far about 80% of patients who get the novel coronavirus experience mild symptoms.
82	if you feel like you have symptoms of the coronavirus, the best thing to do is to call your doctor.
19	but is there a concern though I mean not to paint a darker picture on this but there's a lot about this virus we still don't know.
95	before long john felt better.
78	comedy can't erase the hurt being felt by many in our country.
134	the president rebuking racism is a welcome development and the right thing to do.
44	Here's CNN's medical analyst and infectious disease specialist Doctor Celine gounder.
4	this is largely based on a small study in France that excluded some people who either left the hospital.
138	and some people the virus can stay in the body even after they're no longer showing symptoms.
217	she's in charge of the Medical Center's response to the growing pandemic
248	how much do you think is is too much or how do you prefer to modulate how much information you're taking in.
96	that's my colleague Keon Law Senior National correspondent for CNN.
143	the best way to cheer yourself up is to cheer up someone else.
38	your approach in terms of how you convey knowledge and information whether it be an adult versus a child.
257	not everyone has been able to make it work like Nadia's family.
64	she herself was targeted_
13	meaning only the most serious cases would be reported and there were likely many more cases out there.
183	vaccine Trials take months or years in order to be proven safe and effective for humans.
110	this one is a case-by-case basis.
79	just last week Eugenie grey a blogger in New York was out walking her dog when a passerby kick the dog.
169	the Centers for Disease Control and prevention came out with a report last week that showed young adults between the ages of 20 and 44 were making up 20% of coronavirus hospitalization.
2	and then there's the prospect of a vaccine.
24	unfortunately the list goes on and on, here's what President Trump had to say when a reporter asked him about.
200	I asked him how can you really put a value on a human life.
73	after taking a form of chloroquine used to clean aquariums.
75	but there are experts who believe it is actually much closer to 1%.
231	now these families at that are really suffering economically and they concerned that their quality of life has greatly diminished.
103	there was some early reports in Japan and China of people becoming re-infected.
16	and after touching it wash your own hands with soap and water.
295	people who get infected will typically get sick with a mild-to-moderate upper respiratory tract illness similar to a common cold.
21	so it's not clear if these young adults were more vulnerable to the infections than others.
127	were there any memorable moments that really stood out.
34	I believe him, when he says that it's very unlikely that you'll get the virus again.
62	Banner Health, a company that operates acute care hospitals, released a statement on Monday confirming that a man in Arizona had died.
30	let me tell you what I know.
235	is there a concern that there could be a resurgence of the infection.
168	and how for some people life is slowly beginning to get back to normal.
155	testing every individual given that you're not going to do anything different.
76	experts say one wouldn't be ready this year.
206	the risk of dying is still much higher in older people.
223	getting the results could take months and in the meantime.
249	they were worried because they've been told essentially stay home we can visit them.
213	I asked her if she knows anyone personally who is contracted the Coronavirus.
195	let's walk through some of the biggest myths and give you the facts.
262	and I'm just wondering.
27	experts are still trying to figure out the exact source of the virus but Research indicates that it likely originated in bats.
296	how should I talk to my kids about this?
258	this idea that is people start to come back together again.
145	anti-inflammatories can sometimes suppress your immune system.
15	check in on your neighbors.
98	local community sort of leading the way here in the United States and the federal government seeming to play a little catchup.
105	stop taking the drug dye to side effects or got worse including one person who died.
46	work on a study published last weekend that identified 69 existing drugs that could be tested against the Coronavirus.
164	sometimes you slow down your breath and and then the slowing down of thoughts follows.
268	and will begin trial starting Tuesday.
254	she's reporting on the coronavirus while also taking care of two young children at home.
163	after being asked what treatment he was getting you can hear him struggling to respond.
287	thankfully people have been calling out the racism they are witnessing.
273	but with an early diagnosis and the right treatment they too can recover.
294	the World Health Organization has said these methods are ineffective and shouldn't be used as I can actually irritate your skin or just burn you.
129	could what happened in China happen the United States and doesn't need to happen?
72	at this point it's not clear that pregnant women have a higher risk of getting sicker from the Coronavirus.
278	we all agreed that the even pull out one mask or one swab would be too much.
170	it's hard to practice what you preach within your own job sometimes.
146	the state will also begin testing another experimental treatment.
297	his sentiments are being echoed by other celebrities and government officials.
54	but halfway through, the coronavirus outbreak began.
239	Governor Cuomo's remarks got me thinking about medical ethics and some of the tricky hypotheticals we talked about in medical school.
279	now if you've been in self-isolation at home you should consult your doctor before you make any decisions to come out of isolation and start interacting with anyone else.
47	and that there is maybe increasing suicide rates and things like that.
275	I spoke to him and asked what can we learn from China.
285	if you do think a service or packages contaminated simply use a disinfectant to clean it.
272	the disease can be fatal but those cases are rare.
196	bottom line is don't believe every piece of information you read on the internet.
256	and I'm sure you've all been hearing things from friends on social media and even on mainstream media.
36	but this new study is important because it shows that adults of all ages are at risk of getting really sick.
261	who studies inequality and activism at the Columbia University mailman School of Public Health.
281	I think it helped a lot of people.
189	he has subsequently reported from Beijing and Shanghai and how people adapted to the restrictions put in place.
124	it's possible that those people never fully clear the virus.
14	it's called convalescent serum.
265	they're probably wondering if they'll have a job tomorrow.
90	she's been with the CDC for over 30 years managing responses to H1N1, SARS and Ebola.
31	Nevan Krogan a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institute of data science and biotechnology in San Francisco.
246	many people turn to especially during times of anxiety and uncertainty.
42	how did that strike you when you first heard these reports.
50	the researchers look into that and they think that wasn't actually what was happening.
130	like many parents out there last week CNN senior health producer Nadia Kanein found out her children schools are closing.
252	so for part of this episode, I want to hand things over to CNN's Chief business correspondent Christine Romans.
234	I think you're one of the few people who can really address this question.
283	for some Asian Americans like my colleague Keon Law the damage has been done.
301	and almost half the patients were admitted to the ICU or adults under the age of 64.
67	he was tested every other day for the virus.
264	I spent a lot of time with her out in the field.
199	the company is instead focusing its efforts on giving out the drug in clinical trials.
144	remember Kate Winslet's character the virus hunter.
70	alibris Archer on the project told the New York Times that this is only the tip of the iceberg.
77	I know that it can seem overwhelming.
286	there's this quote attributed to the writer Mark Twain.
85	the Krogan is optimistic that the global response from scientists now will set a precedent for getting to a solution faster.
241	but there's no evidence that any of these in any quantity will protect you from the novel Coronavirus.
119	and I'm curious people anticipate that there will be a bounce back.
222	a few days into the quarantine John started to feel sick.
106	temperatures there remain around 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
26	what's happening with this pandemic.
89	life starting to return to normal.
221	that kind of xenophobia didn't just manifest an individual violence.
80	cannot happen here in the United States.
197	there is no antiviral therapeutic for this, there's no vaccine for this.
132	that was weeks before most of America started staying at home
274	the World Health Organization degrees even though the virus can stay on surfaces for several hours it has to be under the perfect conditions.
5	no matter what you're feeling try to maintain empathy for others.
175	while the number of patients have already received drugs like chloroquine and Remdesivir, it's too early to know how much of an impact the drugs actually had.
122	the key right now is to stop the virus from spreading and for all our health institutions to be prepared to test people and treat those who need it.
